*Milestone Project 1!*

This project will be used to display all that I have learned so far. I will be using this project to build a website to describe what i can do and what i attain to do in the future. 
I will be using this website continuously as I learn new skills and adding new features progressively. At this moment in time i may not have all the skills
I would like to have to incorporate all the features that i would like to have in the finished article.

*UX*

I want my site to be quite minimalistic and simple whilst remaining effective. 
I would like any future employers to look at my site as an advert for what i can do as well as see the willingness to learn new skills.
I have an attractive home page with links to the different pages of interest in the top corner. 
These links will remain the same in my header on every page throughout my project.

The links in my footer will be clear and interactive to catch the users attention. All pages will be linked to each other,
the user will not need to come back to the home page in order to reach a different page. 

I have included my Balsamiq template for my project.

*Features*

In my header i will be having the links illuminate as the cursor moves over them.
Each page will have the same theme running throughout it. I would like to include different colour borders around my sections, page by page to help differentiate the pages. 
On my resume page I will add a download button so employers can download copies of my CV. 
On my contact page i would like to include links to my facebook, linkdIn, twitter etc etc using logos.
I would also like to include a form that can be used to request a collaboration effort.
