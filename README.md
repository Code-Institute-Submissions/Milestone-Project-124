*Milestone Project 1!*

This project will be used to display all that I have learned so far. I will be using this project to build a website to describe what i can do and what i attain to do in the future. 
I will be using this website continuously as I learn new skills and adding new features progressively. At this moment in time i may not have all the skills
I would like to have to incorporate all the features that i would like to have in the finished article.

*UX*

I want my site to be quite minimalistic and simple whilst remaining effective. 
I would like any future employers to look at my site as an advert for what i can do as well as see the willingness to learn new skills.
I have an attractive home page with links to the different pages of interest in the top corner. 
These links will remain the same in my header on every page throughout my project.

The links in my footer will be clear and interactive to catch the users attention. All pages will be linked to each other,
the user will not need to come back to the home page in order to reach a different page. 

I have included my Balsamiq template for my project.

*Features*

In the top left of each page there is a link that will take the user back to the Home Page. This will be a link using "Dwain Daniel, Full Stack Developer"
The links in the header are consistent throughout the site and allow you to get to all pages from any page the user is on. The order of link are consistent, also using icons to 
help to better describe the links.
The links in the Resume section will take the user to the sites I have worked on previously (the ones listed are simply for examples)
The links under Contact Details will take the user to my social media pages and my Git Hub repository


*Features left to implement* 
I would like to add a number of features going forward such as: 
Link the Collaboration form to an external mailbox
Add a download Resume button/link
An online store selling packages for development ideas/pricing plans

*Technologies Used* 
I have built my site using: 

CSS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS 
CSS allows me to edit and decorate my site in the way I see fit. It gives me the ability to edit my HTML and create classes.

HTML https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML 

Bootstrap (4.5.3) https://getbootstrap.com/ 
I used Bootstrap because it allowed me to build a responsive website with the limited knowledge and skills I currently have. It was also used in my Nav Bar and
to separate my divs into separate sizes across my site. 

Balsamiq https://balsamiq.com/# 
I used Balsamiq to help create my template website and try design a quality site. 

*Testing* 

I have tested my site thoroughly, all the links are working and take the user to the correct pages. 
The contact form is fully functioning, if the user inputs an invalid message into any text field then an error message will appear. For example and email address with no @ symbol
The webpage will respond when used on smaller devices, the nav bar will shrink down into a drop down menu. 

*Deployment*

I have used GitHub Pages to deploy the page.
